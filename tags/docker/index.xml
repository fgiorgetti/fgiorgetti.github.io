      <description>Introduction In order to evaluate some strategies for dealing with ingresses using a stable name resolution within a container network (Podman or Docker), I have used the following scenario as the foundation for this study:
In the following sections, I will describe each component in more detail.
Artifacts for each strategy are also available and they can be easily executed using podman-compose or docker compose.
Service Proxies The service proxies are the main objects to be explored here.</description>

      <title>Running skupper-router containers with compose</title>

      <description>A compose file can also be an interesting way to run a static bundle for skupper-routers. Here I am using a two routers network, named west and east.
The west router has an inter-router link (secured with TLS) defined to connect with the east one (using skupper-router-east hostname).
All the configuration, sample certificates and compose files can be downloaded by clicking the following link: Example files (tarball).
Once you extract the tarball, you will find a new directory named example which contains the compose.</description>
