      <description>Introduction In order to evaluate some strategies for dealing with service ingresses, when running the skupper-router with Podman or Docker, I have used this simple scenario below:
The router component is connect to the host network, which avoids restarts when extra ports need to be bound.
In this topology, the my-service workload is reachable from the container&amp;rsquo;s host machine.
It is exposed through the skupper-router container, which is binding port 8080 on the host machine.</description>

      <description>A compose file can also be an interesting way to run a static bundle for skupper-routers. Here I am using a two routers network, named west and east.
The west router has an inter-router link (secured with TLS) defined to connect with the east one (using skupper-router-east hostname).
All the configuration, sample certificates and compose files can be downloaded by clicking the following link: Example files (tarball).
Once you extract the tarball, you will find a new directory named example which contains the compose.</description>
