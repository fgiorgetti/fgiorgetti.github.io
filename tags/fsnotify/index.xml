      <description>Sometimes we need to watch for modifications in specific locations in the filesystem, reacting to them differently.
As an example, an alert could be triggered if a specific file is modified or a backup procedure could start as new files are created into specific directories.
There are several tools and libraries to help doing that, but since I am evaluating libraries in Go, I have decided to play with fsnotify and write a bit about it.</description>
