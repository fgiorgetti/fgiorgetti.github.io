      <description>A compose file can also be an interesting way to run a static bundle for skupper-routers. Here I am using a two routers network, named west and east.
The west router has an inter-router link (secured with TLS) defined to connect with the east one (using skupper-router-east hostname).
All the configuration, sample certificates and compose files can be downloaded by clicking the following link: Example files (tarball).
Once you extract the tarball, you will find a new directory named example which contains the compose.</description>
