      <title>Running skupper-router containers with compose</title>

      <description>A compose file can also be an interesting way to run a static bundle for skupper-routers. Here I am using a two routers network, named west and east.
The west router has an inter-router link (secured with TLS) defined to connect with the east one (using skupper-router-east hostname).
All the configuration files, sample certificates and compose files can be downloaded by clicking the following link: Example files (tarball).
Once you extract the tarball, you will fine a new directory named example which contains the compose.</description>

      <title>Playing with kube files using Podman</title>

      <description>The goal of this exercise is to create two skupper-router containers named skupper-router-east and skupper-router-west with Podman, exposing a TLS AMQP listener on the east router, with all generated credentials and router configuration included as Kubernetes descriptors (using YAML), so that these YAML files can be loaded with podman kube play to spin up the two router pods.
All files mentioned here, can be found below.

      <description>Hybrid Cloud using Skupper Skupper enables service communication, transparently, across multiple Kubernetes clusters.
For more information about Skupper, as well as documentation and great examples, please visit https://skupper.io/.
This article demonstrates how to setup and maintain a Virtual Application Network (VAN) using Skupper.
The standard documented approach for setting up a Skupper network, is through the use of its Command Line Interface (CLI) tool named skupper.
Following its documentation and some examples, you will connect your cloud applications through a set of imperative commands that will help you setting everything up.</description>
