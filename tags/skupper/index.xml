      <description>Introduction When setting up a Skupper network, a single persona doesn’t always have access to all the participant clusters, namespaces, or non-Kubernetes hosts involved.&#xA;This can create a significant hurdle for automation, as Access Tokens or Links generated at one site can’t be automatically shared with a target site.&#xA;To address this, the best approach is to assign separate personas to handle the setup of each site within the Skupper network.</description>

      <description>Introduction Skupper version 2.0.0 has landed and it&amp;rsquo;s bringing a shiny new Ansible collection with it, now available on Ansible Galaxy as skupper.v2.&#xA;This isn&amp;rsquo;t just another update, it&amp;rsquo;s a toolkit that empowers you to define and manage Skupper networks with ease, no matter where they run — Kubernetes, Podman, Docker, or bare-metal Linux.&#xA;Declarative power at your fingertips Skupper 2.0.0 redefines how Virtual Application Networks (VANs) come to life. At its core is a sleek, declarative approach powered by a fresh set of Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs).</description>

      <description>Introduction In order to evaluate some strategies for dealing with ingresses using a stable name resolution within a container network (Podman or Docker), I have used the following scenario as the foundation for this study:&#xA;In the following sections, I will describe each component in more detail.&#xA;Artifacts for each strategy are also available and they can be easily executed using podman-compose or docker compose.&#xA;Service Proxies The service proxies are the main objects to be explored here.</description>

      <description>The goal of this exercise is to create two skupper-router containers named skupper-router-east and skupper-router-west with Podman, exposing a TLS AMQP listener on the east router, with all generated credentials and router configuration included as Kubernetes descriptors (using YAML), so that these YAML files can be loaded with podman kube play to spin up the two router pods.&#xA;All files mentioned here, can be found below.&#xA;Deploying this sample To deploy this sample, run: .</description>
