      <description>Introduction In order to evaluate some strategies for dealing with ingresses using a stable name resolution within a container network (Podman or Docker), I have used the following scenario as the foundation for this study:&#xA;In the following sections, I will describe each component in more detail.&#xA;Artifacts for each strategy are also available and they can be easily executed using podman-compose or docker compose.&#xA;Service Proxies The service proxies are the main objects to be explored here.</description>

      <title>Running skupper-router containers with compose</title>

      <description>A compose file can also be an interesting way to run a static bundle for skupper-routers. Here I am using a two routers network, named west and east.&#xA;The west router has an inter-router link (secured with TLS) defined to connect with the east one (using skupper-router-east hostname).&#xA;All the configuration, sample certificates and compose files can be downloaded by clicking the following link: Example files (tarball).&#xA;Once you extract the tarball, you will find a new directory named example which contains the compose.</description>

      <description>The goal of this exercise is to create two skupper-router containers named skupper-router-east and skupper-router-west with Podman, exposing a TLS AMQP listener on the east router, with all generated credentials and router configuration included as Kubernetes descriptors (using YAML), so that these YAML files can be loaded with podman kube play to spin up the two router pods.&#xA;All files mentioned here, can be found below.&#xA;Deploying this sample To deploy this sample, run: .</description>

      <description>Hybrid Cloud using Skupper Skupper enables service communication, transparently, across multiple Kubernetes clusters.&#xA;For more information about Skupper, as well as documentation and great examples, please visit https://skupper.io/.&#xA;This article demonstrates how to setup and maintain a Virtual Application Network (VAN) using Skupper.&#xA;The standard documented approach for setting up a Skupper network, is through the use of its Command Line Interface (CLI) tool named skupper.&#xA;Following its documentation and some examples, you will connect your cloud applications through a set of imperative commands that will help you setting everything up.</description>
